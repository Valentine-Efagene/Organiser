# Organiser
An application that organises your folder. It is added to the registry, so it appears as an option in the context menu.

Organizer is a console application I built to organize a folder into structured subfolders.
•	Organizer was built using C#
•	Organizer is a windows console application
•	Organizer should be installed on the windows context-menu, so that on right-clicking in a folder you see the option to organize it.
•	A demo is provided on my YouTube channel, at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1ajLtmc9d4
